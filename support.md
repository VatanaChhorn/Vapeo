## Frequently Asked Questions

### App Basics

**Q: How do I log a vape break?**  
A: Simply tap the "+" button on the home screen each time you take a vape break. This builds awareness and helps track your patterns.

**Q: How do I view my progress?**  
A: Tap the "Progress" tab to see your statistics, charts, and analytics showing your vaping patterns over time.

**Q: What are streaks and how do they work?**  
A: Your streak shows consecutive days without vaping. Each day you don't log any vape breaks adds to your streak, helping you stay motivated.

### AI Insights

**Q: How many AI insights can I get per day?**  
A: Currently, you can receive up to 5 AI-powered analyses per day. This limit resets daily and helps us provide quality insights to all users.

**Q: When will I be able to get unlimited AI insights?**  
A: We're working on Vapeo Premium, which will include unlimited AI analyses. Stay tuned for updates!

**Q: Why are my AI insights limited?**  
A: To keep the service free and fair for everyone while managing costs. The limitation ensures quality insights for all users.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Your data is stored privately in your iCloud account. We cannot access your personal information - it stays completely under your control.

**Q: Does my data sync across devices?**  
A: Yes! Your progress automatically syncs across all your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac) through your private iCloud storage.

**Q: How do I reset my data?**  
A: Go to Settings (More tab) ‚Üí Data Management ‚Üí Reset All Data. **Warning:** This permanently deletes all your progress and cannot be undone.

A: Please [submit a support request](https://tally.so/r/n9gaaK) with details about what you were doing when the issue occurred, your device model, and iOS version.

**Q: My data isn't syncing between devices**  
A: Ensure you're signed into the same iCloud account on all devices and that iCloud is enabled for the app in Settings ‚Üí [Your Name] ‚Üí iClouds.

A: Charts require at least a few data points. Try logging some vape breaks first, then check the Progress tab.
